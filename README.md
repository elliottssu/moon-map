## Introduction

**About project positioning**

1. This project is similar to [NASA Moon Trek](https://trek.nasa.gov/) and uses trekApi to achieve similar map effects.
2. The difference is that the address of NASA's Trek image server is abroad, and the access speed in China is very slow, so I transferred all the image addresses to China to facilitate everyone's access.
3. NASA's layers are great, but they don't support customization, so the purpose of this project is to add layers according to your own ideas.

**To do:**
Development of 3D renderings; adding more detector layers to display.
